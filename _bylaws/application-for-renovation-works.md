## Rule 1 - Owner Application Requirement

1) Only owners may apply for approval to carry out renovation works to their housing units. Applications for approval of renovation works must be made at the Management Office during office hours.

## Rule 2 - Security Deposit

2) Owners will be required to place a security deposit of $81,000.00 by cheque made payable to "The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 2405" at least Seven (7) days before commencement of work. Security deposit will be refunded free from interest upon completion of the renovation works if the Management is satisfied that no damage has been caused to any common areas and that all debris and unused or unwanted or waste materials have been cleared and removed from the estate. In the event of damage to any common area or failure to clear and remove any debris and/or waste materials, the cost incurred by the Management to rectify the damage will be at the expenses of the owner concerned. Such cost may be offset against the security deposit and the balance thereof (if any) refunded to the owner. Where the expenses exceeds the security deposit, the owner shall reimburse the Management the difference. It shall be the responsibility of the owners to inform their contractors of these requirements.

## Rule 3 - Letter of Undertaking

3) Owners will also be required to submit a Letter of Undertaking to the Management that they shall be responsible for their renovation contractors in complying with the rules stipulated.

## Rule 4 - Work Schedule Submission

4) Owners and their contractors must inform the Management of their schedules of work TWO (2) weeks before the commencement of work. Works may not commence until written approval has been granted.
